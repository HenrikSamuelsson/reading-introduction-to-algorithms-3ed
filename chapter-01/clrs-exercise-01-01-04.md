# Solution Exercise 1.1-4

The shortest-path and travelling-salesman problems are similar due to that the goal of both problems is to minimize the length of a path.

They are different due to that only two stops are required in the shortest-path problem and these two stops will only be visited once, but in the travelling-salesman problem so will more stops be required and a stop might be passed by more than one time.
