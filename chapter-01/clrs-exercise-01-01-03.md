# Solution Exercise 1.1-3

The linked list is a example of a data structure. Below follows a discussion on the strengths and limitations of this data structure.

Strengths:

- Number of elements can be changed dynamically at run time

- Insertion and deletion of elements in the list is fast

Weaknesses:

- Requires memory in each element to track location of the next element

- Random access is slow compared to storing the data in an array

- No guarantee that the elements are placed together in memory which can affect caching performance
