# Solution Exercise 1.1-5

Sometimes there is a requirement that an algorithm shall produce the very best solution, and sometimes a good enough approximate solution will do.

A real world problem in which only the best solution will do is sorting words into a dictionary. A word not placed in the correct alphabetical order will make it time consuming to find the word and its explanation.

A real world problem in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough is weather forecasts. These are just approximately right but still adds value. A forecast will for example be helpful when to choose what clothes to pack when travelling away over a weekend.
